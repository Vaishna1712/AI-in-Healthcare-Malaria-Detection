# AI-in-Healthcare-Malaria-Detection

Diagnose malaria with precision using machine learning. Dataset includes Giemsa-stained blood smear slides. Employ MobileNetV2 for effective transfer learning. Join in to enhance global health diagnostics! Explore and innovate together!


Overview:

This project focuses on advancing malaria diagnosis through the power of machine learning. With a dataset comprising Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P. falciparum-infected and 50 healthy patients, collected at Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh, our goal is to contribute to healthcare in resource-constrained regions.
